                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1.2 Subscription Period and Billing</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Subscriptions are billed on a monthly basis. The first payment is due upfront before services commence.

                    <p class="mb-4">We reserve the right to cancel your Subscription at any time for any reason, including but not limited to: violation of these Terms, abusive behavior, unreasonable demands beyond the scope of the service, or at our sole discretion. In case of cancellation by us, you will be notified via email, and no further charges will be applied from the cancellation date.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1.4 Subscription Pausing</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">You may pause your Subscription at any time by notifying us at least 7 days before your next billing date. During the pause period, no work will be performed, and you will not be charged. You may resume your Subscription at any time by notifying us, and billing will restart on the next regular billing cycle.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1.5 Refunds and Satisfaction Guarantee</h3>

                    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1.6 Third-Party Costs</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">All costs related to hosting, domain registration, third-party APIs, email services, storage, database services, or any other external services required for your project are your sole responsibility. Launch Brick does not cover, pay for, or reimburse any of these costs. You agree to set up and maintain accounts for all necessary third-party services directly, providing appropriate access to Launch Brick as needed for service delivery.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4" id="intellectual-property">2. Intellectual Property</h2>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2.2 Revocation of Rights</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">In the event that you receive a refund for any reason, all intellectual property rights to the code, designs, and other deliverables created during the subscription period will automatically revert to Launch Brick. You will lose all rights to use, modify, or distribute any materials created during the service period.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2.3 Pre-existing Materials</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Launch Brick retains all intellectual property rights to pre-existing code, frameworks, tools, libraries, and methodologies that were created by Launch Brick prior to your subscription or were not created specifically for your project. Launch Brick grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use these pre-existing materials solely in conjunction with the deliverables created for your project.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3.1 Equity Agreement</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">For clients selecting the Equity Partnership option, a separate Equity Agreement will be provided that outlines specific terms, including equity percentage, vesting schedule, and other conditions. The Equity Agreement will take precedence over these Terms for any conflicting provisions specifically related to the equity arrangement.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3.2 Minimum Commitment</h3>

                    <p class="mb-4">A "task" is defined as a discrete unit of work that can be reasonably accomplished within our service framework. Launch Brick has the sole discretion to determine whether a requested feature constitutes one or multiple tasks. Our website provides examples of what constitutes a single task versus larger scopes of work that would require multiple tasks.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4.2 Service Availability</h3>

In such cases, we will provide advance notice when possible and adjust delivery timelines accordingly.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4.3 Communication</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">After initial onboarding, all communication will be conducted through designated project management tools (e.g., Trello).
