                        <li>For any third-party costs incurred on your behalf (domain registrations, hosting services, API credits, etc.)</li>

                    <p class="mb-4">In certain circumstances, we may offer partial refunds at our discretion if:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
                        <li>We failed to deliver a substantial portion of the agreed-upon work</li>
                        <li>We were unable to meet critical deadlines as specified in our service agreement</li>

                    <p class="mb-4">The amount of any partial refund will be determined based on the proportion of work completed, the nature of the issue, and other relevant factors.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4" id="subscription-cancellations">4. Subscription Cancellations</h2>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">Cancelling your subscription does not automatically qualify you for a refund. When you cancel your subscription:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
                        <li>You will continue to have access to the service until the end of your current billing period</li>
                        <li>No additional charges will be made after cancellation</li>
                        <li>You will retain access to all completed deliverables provided during your active subscription period</li>

                    <p class="mb-4">Instead of cancelling, you may pause your subscription for up to 3 months. During the paused period:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
                        <li>You will not be charged during the pause</li>
                        <li>No new work will be initiated or completed</li>
                        <li>Your existing work and backlog will be preserved</li>
                        <li>You can resume your subscription at any time within the pause period</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">Pausing your subscription is not eligible for refunds but may be a preferable alternative if you anticipate returning to the project.</p>

                        <li>Refunds will be processed using the same payment method used for the original transaction</li>
                        <li>Refund processing typically takes 5-10 business days, depending on your payment provider</li>
                        <li>You will receive a confirmation email once the refund has been processed</li>
                    </ul>
